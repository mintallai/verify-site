# - Their build produces a dist folder
# - Their entry point asset exists at the top of dist
# - All child assets are placed in dist/__VERSION__
#
# They also must acknowledge that at deploy time:
# - The string __VERSION__ will be replaced in all of their assets with a
#   string unique to the deployment
# - The contents of the dist/__VERSION__ folder will be deployed to a new
#   subfolder of dist in the S3 bucket named using that same unique string
# - Any files under dist/__VERSION__ will be assigned a long cache time
#   (default 1 day). All other files will be assigned a short cache time
#   (default 1 minute).
