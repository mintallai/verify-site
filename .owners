    # We WANT to be able to define a single path rule to match everything in the repository (i.e. **/*).
    # However, Moonbeam doesn't currently match dot files or folders when evaluating ** or *.
    # As such, we have to use a number of path rules to achieve our goal. The following set of path rules is
    # sufficient for most repositories. However, dot folders, anywhere in the hierarchy, must be addressed
    # explicitly, similar to how we've addressed ".porter" and ".precode".
    paths:
      # All files in the repo root, except dot files.
      - "*"

      # All dot files in the repo root.
      - ".*"

      # All nested files, except dot files or files in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - "**/*"

      # All nested dot files, except those in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - "**/.*"

      # All nested files in the ".porter" folder, except dot files or files in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - ".porter/**/*"

      # All nested dot files in the ".porter" folder, except those in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - ".porter/**/.*"

      # All nested files in the ".precode" folder, except dot files or files in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - ".precode/**/*"

      # All nested dot files in the ".precode" folder, except those in any hierarchy containing a dot folder.
      - ".precode/**/.*"
